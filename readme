## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Throughout this subject, I've learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

- Consistent naming conventions improve code readability and maintainability
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle helps reduce code duplication and potential errors
- Proper commenting and documentation make code more understandable for others (and future you)
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions enhances code structure
- Version control (like Git) is crucial for tracking changes and collaborating with others
